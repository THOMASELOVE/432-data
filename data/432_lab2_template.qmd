## Loading the Data {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}

After downloading the `hbp_3024.xlsx` file to your computer, you should ingest the data using `read_xlsx()` from the `readxl` package. Be sure to handle the missingness properly.

Note that the resulting tibble should have 3024 rows and 23 columns, and you should see missing data on 8 of the 23 variables, including for example, LDL cholesterol.
